## Documentation

This COBOL program, `CBL0011`, generates a financial report summarizing account information. It reads account data from the `ACCT-REC` file, calculates total account limits and balances, and writes a formatted report to the `PRINT-LINE` file.  The report includes account number, last name (formatted with initial capital and lowercase), account limit, and account balance for each record.  Report headers display the current date and descriptive column titles.  Report footers display the grand totals for account limits and balances.


## Sections/Paragraphs

**OPEN-FILES:** Opens the input file `ACCT-REC` and the output file `PRINT-LINE`.

**WRITE-HEADERS:** Writes the report headers to the `PRINT-LINE` file. This includes a title, the current date, and column headers.

**READ-NEXT-RECORD:** This paragraph controls the main processing loop.  It reads records until the end of the input file is reached. Within the loop, it performs the `LIMIT-BALANCE-TOTAL` and `WRITE-RECORD` paragraphs.

**WRITE-TLIMIT-TBALANCE:** Writes the calculated total account limit and total account balance to the report footer.

**CLOSE-STOP:** Closes the input and output files and terminates the program.

**READ-RECORD:** Reads a single record from the `ACCT-REC` file.  Sets the `LASTREC` flag to 'Y' when the end of the file is reached.

**LIMIT-BALANCE-TOTAL:** Accumulates the account limit and account balance from the current record into the `TLIMIT` and `TBALANCE` variables, respectively.

**WRITE-RECORD:** Formats and writes a single account record's details to the output file, `PRINT-LINE`. Formats the last name to have an initial capital letter followed by lowercase.
